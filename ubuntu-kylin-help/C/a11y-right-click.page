    Simulate a right mouse click
  </title>

  <p>
    You can right-click by holding down the left mouse button. This is useful if 
    you find it difficult to move your fingers individually on one hand, or if 
    your pointing device only has a single button.
  </p>

  <steps>
    <item>
      <if:choose>
        <if:when test="platform:unity">
          <p>
            Click the icon at the very right of the <gui>menu bar</gui> and 
            select <gui>System Settings</gui>.
          </p>
        </if:when>
        <p>
          Click your name on the menu bar and select <gui>System Settings</gui>.
        </p>
      </if:choose>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>
        Open <gui>Universal Access</gui> and select the <gui>Pointing and 
        Clicking</gui> tab.
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>
        Switch <gui>Simulated Secondary Click</gui> on.
      </p>
    </item>
  </steps>

  <p>
    You can change how long you must hold down the left mouse button before it 
    is registered as a right click. On the <gui>Pointing and Clicking</gui> tab, 
    change the <gui>Acceptance delay</gui> under <gui>Simulated Secondary 
    Click</gui>.
  </p>

  <p>
    To right-click with simulated secondary click, hold down the left mouse 
    button where you would normally right-click, then release. The pointer fills 
    with blue as you hold down the left mouse button. Once it is entirely blue, 
    release the mouse button to right-click.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some special pointers, such as the resize pointers, do not change colors. 
    You can still use simulated secondary click as normal, even if you don't get 
    visual feedback from the pointer.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you use <link xref="mouse-mousekeys">Mouse Keys</link>, this also allows 
    you to right-click by holding down the <key>5</key> key on your keypad.
  </p>

  <if:choose>
    <if:when test="platform:unity">
    </if:when>
    <note>
      <p>
        In the <gui>Activities</gui> overview, you are always able to long-press 
        to right-click, even with this feature disabled. Long-press works 
        slightly differently in the overview: You do not have to release the 
        button to right-click.
