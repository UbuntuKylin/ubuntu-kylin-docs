  <title>Create a connection with a fixed IP address</title>

 <p>Most networks will automatically assign an <link xref="net-what-is-ip-address">IP address</link> and other details to your computer when you connect to the network. These details can change periodically, but you might want to have a fixed IP address for the computer so you always know what its address is (for example, if it is a file server).</p>
  <p>To give your computer a fixed (static) IP address:</p>

<steps>
<item><p>Click the <gui>network menu</gui> on the menu bar and select <gui>Edit Connections</gui>.</p></item>
<item><p>Select the <gui>Wired connection</gui> on the <gui>Wired</gui> tab or your WiFi network on the <gui>Wireless</gui> tab and click <gui>Edit</gui>.</p></item>
<item><p>Click on the <gui>IPv4 Settings</gui> tab and change the <gui>Method</gui> to <em>Manual</em>.</p></item>
<item><p>If no connection information is listed in the <gui>Addresses</gui> list, or if you want to set up a new connection, click <gui>Add</gui>.</p></item>
<item><p>Enter the <em>IP Address</em>, <em>Netmask</em>, and <em>Gateway</em> information into the appropriate boxes. How you choose these will depend on your network setup; there are specific rules governing which IP addresses and netmasks are valid for a given network.</p></item>
<item><p>If necessary, enter a <em>Domain Name Server</em> address into the <gui>DNS servers</gui> box. This is the IP address of a server which looks up domain names; most corporate networks and internet providers have dedicated DNS servers.</p></item>
<item><p>Click <gui>Save</gui>. The network connection should now have a fixed IP address.</p></item>
</steps>
