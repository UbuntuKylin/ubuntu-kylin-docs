<title>Why won't my computer turn back on after I suspended it?</title>

<p>If you <link xref="power-suspend">suspend</link> or <link
xref="power-hibernate">hibernate</link> your computer, then try to resume it or
turn it back on, you may find that it does not work as you expected. This could
be because suspend and hibernate aren't supported properly by your
hardware.</p>

<section id="resume">
  <title>My computer is suspended and isn't resuming</title>
  <p>If you suspend your computer and then press a key or click the mouse, it
  should wake up and display a screen asking for your password. If this doesn't
 happen, try pressing the power button (don't hold it in, just press it
  once).</p>
  <p>If this still doesn't help, make sure that your computer's monitor is
  switched on and try pressing a key on the keyboard again.</p>
  <p>As a last resort, turn off the computer by holding in the power button for
  5-10 seconds, although you will lose any unsaved work by doing this. You
  should then be able to turn on the computer again.</p>
  <p>If this happens every time you suspend your computer, the suspend
  feature may not work with your hardware.</p>
  <note style="warning">
    <p>If your computer loses power and doesn't have an alternative power
    supply (such as a working battery), it will switch off.</p>

<section id="hibernate">
  <title>None of my applications/documents are open when I turn on the computer
  again</title>
  <p>If you hibernated your computer and switched it on again, but none of your
  documents or applications are open, it probably failed to hibernate properly.
  Sometimes this happens because of a minor problem, and the computer will be
  able to hibernate properly the next time you do it. It might also happen
  because you had installed a software update which required the computer to be
  restarted; in this case, the computer may have shut down instead of
  hibernating.</p>
  <p>It is also possible that the computer is not capable of hibernating
  because the hardware doesn't support it properly. This might be because of a
  problem with Linux drivers for your hardware, for example. You can test this
  by hibernating again and seeing if it works the second time. If it doesn't,
  it is probably a problem with your computer's drivers.</p>

<section id="hardware">
  <title>My wireless connection (or other hardware) doesn't work when I wake
  up my computer</title>
  <p>If you suspend or hibernate your computer and then resume it again, you
  may find that your internet connection, mouse, or some other device doesn't
  work properly. This could be because the device's driver doesn't
  properly support suspend or hibernate. This is a <link
  xref="hardware-driver">problem with the driver</link> and not the device
  itself.</p>
  <p>If the device has a power switch, try turning it off and then on again. In
  most cases, the device will start working again. If it connects via a USB
  cable or similar, unplug the device and then plug it in again and see if it
  works.</p>
  <p>If you cannot turn off/unplug the device, or if this does not work, you
  may need to restart your computer for the device to start working again.</p>
