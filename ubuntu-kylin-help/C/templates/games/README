This is a template Mallard document for application help for games.

Each template topic has a comment which explains how it should be used.

GENERIC.page.stub can be used as a generic topic page. Just make a copy, rename it, and edit the file to create a new topic. There are a few useful bits of Mallard markup in there already to save on typing.

Rename the pages from ".page.stub" to ".page" when you have edited them.

Contact the GNOME Documentation Team (gnome-doc-list@gnome.org) for help with this template.
