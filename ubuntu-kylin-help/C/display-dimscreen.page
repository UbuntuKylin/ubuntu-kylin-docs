  <title>Set screen brightness</title>

  <p>You can change the brightness of your screen to save power or to make the
  screen more readable in bright light. You can also have the screen dim
  automatically when on battery power and have it turn off automatically when
  not in use.</p>

  <steps>
    <title>Set the brightness</title>
  <item><p>Click the icon at the very right of the <gui>menu bar</gui> and select <gui>System Settings</gui>.</p></item>
    <item><p>Select <gui>Brightness &amp; Lock</gui>.</p></item>
    <item><p>Adjust the <gui>Brightness</gui> slider to a comfortable value.</p></item>
  </steps>

  <note style="tip">
    <p>Many laptop keyboards have special keys to adjust the brightness. These
    have a picture that looks like the sun and are located on the function
    keys at the top. Hold down the <key>Fn</key> key to use these keys.</p>
  </note>

  <p>Select <gui>Dim screen to save power</gui> to have the brightness
  automatically lowered when you're on battery power. The backlight of your
  screen can take a lot of power and significantly reduce how long your battery
  will last before it needs to be recharged.</p>

  <p>The screen will automatically turn off after you haven't used it for a
  while. This only affects the display, and doesn't turn off your computer.
  You can adjust how long you have to be inactive with the <gui>Turn screen off
  when inactive for</gui> option.</p>
