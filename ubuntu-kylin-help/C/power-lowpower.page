<title>Why did my computer turn off/suspend when the battery got to 10%?</title>

<p>When the charge level of the battery gets too low, your computer will
automatically <link xref="power-suspend">suspend</link>. It does this to
make sure that the battery doesn't completely discharge, since this is bad for
the battery. If the battery just ran out, the computer wouldn't have time to
shut down properly either.</p>

<p>You can change what happens when the battery level gets too low. First, click the 
<gui>battery menu</gui> in the <gui>menu bar</gui> and select <gui>Power Settings</gui>. At the <gui>'When
power is critically low'</gui> setting, you can choose for the computer to
suspend, <link xref="power-hibernate">hibernate</link>, or shut down. If you choose shut down, your applications and
documents <em>will not</em> be saved when the computer turns off.</p>

<p>Some computers have problems suspending, and may not be able to recover the
applications and documents you had open when you turn on the computer again. In
this case, it is possible that you could lose some of your work if you didn't
save it before the computer suspended. You may be able to <link
xref="power-suspendfail">fix problems with suspend</link> though.</p>
