<title>Windows and workspaces</title>

<p>Like other desktops, Unity uses windows to display your running applications. Using both the <gui>Dash</gui> and the <gui>Launcher</gui>, you can launch new applications and control which window is active.</p>

<p>In addition to windows, you can also group your applications together within workspaces. Visit the window and workspace help topics below to better learn how to use these features.</p>
<!--

Want to keep this intro simple . . . what to do here?

<p>In the <gui>Activities</gui> overview, the <gui>Dash</gui> displays your favorite applications as well as your running applications. The <gui>Dash</gui> will place a slight glow behind any running applications.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clicking on the application icon will launch it if it is not running, and will open the last used window of that application if it is already running.
</p>

<p>
Right clicking on the application icon for a running application will bring all windows for that application forward. A menu with the titles of your windows will be displayed.  You can select a window from this menu. It also provides options to open a new window for that application and to remove or add that application to favorites depending on its current status.
</p>

<p>
   Windows are shown on their corresponding <link xref="shell-windows-workspaces">workspaces</link>.

<comment><p>Briefly explain the different window states that exist and how you can use and recognize those states. Discuss interesting ways of arranging windows (i.e. if there is a "Tile" option or something like that). Mention, in passing, how you can move and resize windows in multiple ways.</p>
<p>Very brief overview of what you can do with windows. Link to relevant topics.</p>
