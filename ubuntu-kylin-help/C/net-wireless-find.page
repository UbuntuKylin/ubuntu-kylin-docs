<title>I can't see my wireless network in the list</title>

<p>There are a number of reasons why you might not be able to see your wireless network on the list of networks which appears when you click the network icon on the menu bar.</p>

<list>
 <item>
  <p>If no networks are shown in the list, your wireless hardware could be turned off, or it <link xref="net-wireless-troubleshooting">may not be working properly</link>. Make sure it is turned on.</p>
 </item>

 <item>
  <p>If there are lots of wireless networks nearby, the network you are looking for might not be on the first page of the list. If this is the case, look at the bottom of the list for an arrow pointing towards the right and hover your mouse over it to display the rest of the wireless networks.</p>
 </item>

 <item>
  <p>You could be out of range of the network. Try moving closer to the wireless base station/router and see if the network appears in the list after a while.</p>
 </item>

 <item>
  <p>The list of wireless networks takes time to update. If you have just turned on your computer or moved to a different location, wait for a minute or so and then check if the network has appeared in the list.</p>
 </item>

 <item>
  <p>The network could be hidden. You need to <link xref="net-wireless-hidden">connect in a different way</link> if it is a hidden network.</p>
