<title>Open applications for devices or discs</title>

<p>You can have an application automatically start when you plug in a device
or insert a disc or media card. For example, you might want your photo organizer
to start when you plug in a digital camera. You can also turn this off, so that
nothing happens when you plug something in.</p>

<p>To decide which applications should start when you plug in various devices:
</p>

<steps>
  <item><p>Click the icon at the very right of the <gui>menu bar</gui> and select <gui>System Settings</gui>.
  </p></item>
  <item><p>Select <guiseq><gui>Details</gui><gui>Removable Media</gui></guiseq>.
  </p></item>
  <item>
    <p>Find your desired device or media type, and then choose an application
    or action for that media type. See below for a description of the different
    types of devices and media.</p>
    <p>Instead of starting an application, you can also set it so that the device
    will be shown in the file manager. When that happens, you will be asked
    what to do, or nothing will happen automatically.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <p>The <gui>Software</gui> option is slightly different from the others - 
if the computer detects that there is software on a disk that you inserted, 
it can try to automatically run the software if you like. This is good if you 
have an application installed on a CD and want it to start when the disc is inserted (for example, a slideshow).</p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <p>If you don't see the device or media type that you want to change in the
    list (such as Blu-ray discs or E-book readers), click <gui>Other Media</gui>
    to see a more detailed list of devices. Select the type of device or media
    from the <gui>Type</gui> drop-down and the application or action from the
    <gui>Action</gui> drop-down.</p>
  </item>
</steps>

<note style="tip">
<p>If you don't want any applications to be opened automatically, whatever you
plug in, select <gui>Never prompt or start programs on media insertion</gui> at
the bottom of the Removable Media window.</p>

  <item>
    <title>Audio discs</title>
    <p>Choose your favorite music application or CD audio extractor to handle
    audio CDs. If you use audio DVDs (DVD-A), select how to open them under
    <gui>Other Media</gui>. If you open an audio disc with the file manager,
    the tracks will appear as WAV files that you can play in any audio player
    application.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title>Video discs</title>
    <p>Choose your favorite video application to handle video DVDs. Use the
    <gui>Other Media</gui> button to set an application for Blu-ray, HD DVD,
    video CD (VCD), and super video CD (SVCD). If DVDs or other video discs
    do not work correctly when you insert them, see <link xref="video-dvd"/>.
    </p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title>Blank discs</title>
    <p>Use the <gui>Other Media</gui> button to select a disc-writing
    application for blank CDs, blank DVDs, blank Blu-ray discs, and blank HD
    DVDs.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title>Cameras and photos</title>
    <p>Use the <gui>Photos</gui> drop-down to choose a photo-management
    application to run when you plug in your digital camera, or when you insert
    a media card from a camera, such as a CF, SD, MMC, or MS card. You can also
    simply browse your photos using the file manager.</p>
    <p>Under <gui>Other Media</gui>, you can select an application to open Kodak
    picture CDs, such as those you might have made in a store. These are regular
    data CDs with JPEG images in a folder called <file>PICTURES</file>.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title>Music players</title>
    <p>Choose an application to manage the music library on your portable music
    player, or manage the files yourself using the file manager.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title>E-book readers</title>
    <p>Use the <gui>Other Media</gui> button to choose an application to manage the
    books on your e-book reader, or manage the files yourself using the file manager.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title>Software</title>
    <p>Some discs and removable media contain software that is supposed to be run
    automatically when the media is inserted. Use the <gui>Software</gui> option
    to control what to do when media with autorun software is inserted. You will
    always be prompted for a confirmation before software is run.</p>
    <note style="warning">
      <p>Never run software from media you don't trust.</p>
