<title>Adjust the double-click speed</title>

<p>Double-clicking only happens when you press the mouse button twice
quickly enough. If the second press is too long after the first, you'll
just get two separate clicks, not a double click. If you have difficulty
pressing the mouse button quickly, you should increase the timeout.</p>

<steps>
  <item><p>Click the icon at the very right of the <gui>menu bar</gui> and select <gui>System Settings</gui>.</p></item>
  <item><p>Open <gui>Mouse &amp; Touchpad</gui>.</p></item>
  <item><p>Under <gui>General</gui>, adjust the <gui>Double-click</gui>
  slider to a value you find comfortable.</p></item>
  <item><p>Click the <gui>Test Your Settings</gui> button to test. A single
  click in the window will highlight the outer circle. A double-click will
  highlight the inside circle.</p></item>
</steps>

<p>If your mouse double-clicks when you want it to single-click
even though you have increased the double-click timeout,
your mouse may be faulty. Try plugging a different mouse into your computer
and see if that works properly. Alternatively, plug your mouse into a
different computer and see if it still has the same problem.
</p>

<note><p>This setting will affect both your mouse and touchpad,
as well as any other pointing device.</p></note>
