      Testing color management isn't hard, and we even supply some test 
      profiles.

  <title>How do I test if color management is working correctly?</title>
  <p>
    The effects of a color profile are sometimes subtle and it may be
    hard to see if anything much has changed.
  </p>
  <p>
    In GNOME we ship several profiles for testing that make it very
    clear when the profiles are being applied:
  </p>

  <list>
    <item>
      <p>
        <em>Bluish Test</em>: This will turn the screen blue and tests
        if the calibration curves are being sent to the display
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>
        <em>ADOBEGAMMA-test</em>: This will turn the screen pink and
        tests different features of a screen profile
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>
        <em>FakeBRG</em>: This will not change the screen, but will swap
        around the RGB channels to become BGR.
        This will make all the colors gradients look mostly correct, and
        there won't be much difference on the whole screen, but images
        will look very different in applications that support color
        management.
      </p>
    </item>
  </list>

  <p>
    Add one of the test profiles to your display device using the
    <guiseq><gui>System Settings</gui><gui>Color</gui></guiseq>
    preferences.
  </p>

  <p>
    Using these profiles you can clearly see when an application
    supports color management.
