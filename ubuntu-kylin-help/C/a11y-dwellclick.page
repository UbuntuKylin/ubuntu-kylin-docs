    Simulate clicking by hovering
  </title>

  <p>
    You can click or drag simply by hovering your mouse pointer over a control 
    or object on the screen. This is useful if you find it difficult to move the 
    mouse and click at the same time. This feature is called Hover Click or 
    Dwell Click.
  </p>

  <p>
    When Hover Click is enabled, you can move your mouse pointer over a control, 
    let go of the mouse, and then wait for a while before the button will be 
    clicked for you.
  </p>

  <steps>
    <item>
      <if:choose>
        <if:when test="platform:unity">
          <p>
            Click the icon at the very right of the <gui>menu bar</gui> and 
            select <gui>System Settings</gui>.
          </p>
        </if:when>
        <p>
          Click your name on the menu bar and select <gui>System Settings</gui>.
        </p>
      </if:choose>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>
        Open <gui>Universal Access</gui> and select the <gui>Pointing and 
        Clicking</gui> tab.
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>
        Switch <gui>Hover Click</gui> on.
      </p>
    </item>
  </steps>

  <p>
    The <gui>Hover Click</gui> window will open, and will stay above all of your 
    other windows. You can use this to choose what sort of click should happen 
    when you hover. For example, if you select <gui>Secondary Click</gui>, you 
    will right-click when you hover. After you double-click, right-click, or 
    drag, you will be automatically returned to clicking.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you hover your mouse pointer over a button and don't move it, it will 
    gradually change color. When it has fully changed color, the button will be 
    clicked.
  </p>

  <p>
    Adjust the <gui>Delay</gui> setting to change how long you have to hold the 
    mouse pointer still before clicking.
  </p>

  <p>
    You don't need to hold the mouse perfectly still when hovering to click. The 
    pointer is allowed to move a little bit and will still click after a while. 
    If it moves too much, however, the click will not happen.
  </p>

  <p>
    Adjust the <gui>Motion threshold</gui> setting to change how much the 
    pointer can move and still be considered to be hovering.
