  <title>How do I calibrate my screen?</title>

  <p>
    Calibrating your screen should be a requirement if you're involved in 
    computer design or artwork.

  <p>
    By using a device called colorimeter you accurately measure the
    different colors that your screen is able to display.
    By running <guiseq><gui>System Settings</gui><gui>Color</gui></guiseq>
    you can create a profile, and the wizard will show you how to attach 
    the colorimeter device and what settings to adjust.

  <note style="tip">
    <p>
      Screens change all the time - the backlight in a TFT will half in
      brightness approximately every 18 months, and will get yellower
      as it gets older.
      This means you should recalibrate your screen when the [!] icon
      appears in the color control panel.
    </p>
    <p>
      LED screens also change over time, but a much slower rate than TFTs.
