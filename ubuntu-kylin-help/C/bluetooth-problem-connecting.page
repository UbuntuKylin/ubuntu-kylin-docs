<title>I can't connect my Bluetooth device</title>

<p>There are a number of reasons why you may not be able to connect to a 
Bluetooth device, such as a phone or headset.</p>

<terms>
  <item>
    <title>Connection blocked or untrusted</title>
    <p>Some Bluetooth devices block connections by default, or require you to 
    change a setting to allow connections to be made. Make sure that your device 
    is set up to allow connections.</p>

    <title>Bluetooth hardware not recognized</title>
    <p>Your Bluetooth adapter/dongle may not have been recognized by the 
    computer. This could be because <link xref="hardware-driver">drivers</link> 
    for the adapter aren't installed. Some Bluetooth adapters aren't supported 
    on Linux, so you may not be able to get the right drivers for them. In this 
    case, you will probably have to get a different Bluetooth adapter.</p>

    <title>Device Bluetooth connection switched off</title>
  <p>Check that Bluetooth is turned on on the device you're trying to connect 
  to. For example, if you're trying to connect to a phone, make sure that it's 
  not in airplane mode.</p>

  <title>No Bluetooth adapter in your computer</title>
