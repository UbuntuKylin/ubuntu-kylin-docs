<title>Print envelopes and labels</title>

<p>Most printers will allow you to print directly onto an envelope or sheet of
 labels. This is especially useful if you have a lot of letters to send, for
 example.</p>

<section id="envelope">
 <title>Printing onto envelopes</title>

 <p>There are two things you need to check when trying to print onto an envelope.
 The first is that your printer knows what size the envelope is. After you click
 <gui>Print</gui> and the Print window appears, go to the <gui>Page Setup</gui>
 tab and choose the <gui>Paper type</gui> as "Envelope" if you can. If you can't
 do this, see if you can change the <gui>Paper size</gui> to an envelope size
 (e.g. "C5"). The pack of envelopes will say what size they are; most envelopes
 come in standard sizes.</p>

 <p>Secondly, you need to make sure that the envelopes are loaded with the right
 side up in the printer's in-tray. Check the printer's manual for this, or try
 to print a single envelope and check which side is printed on to see which way
 is the right way up.</p>

<note style="warning">
 <p>Some printers are not designed to be able to print envelopes, especially some
 laser printers. Check your printer's manual to see if it accepts envelopes;
 otherwise, you could damage the printer by feeding an envelope in.</p>
