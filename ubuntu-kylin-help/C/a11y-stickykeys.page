  <title>
    Turn on sticky keys
  </title>

  <p>
    <em>Sticky keys</em> allows you to type keyboard shortcuts one key at a time 
    rather than having to hold down all of the keys at once. For example, the 
    <keyseq><key>Alt</key><key>Tab</key></keyseq> shortcut switches between 
    windows. Without sticky keys turned on, you would have to hold down both 
    keys at the same time; with sticky keys turned on, you would press 
    <key>Alt</key> and then <key>Tab</key> to do the same.
  </p>

  <p>
    You might want to turn on sticky keys if you find it difficult to hold down 
    several keys at once.

  <steps>
    <item>
      <p>
        Click the icon at the very right of the <gui>menu bar</gui> and select 
        <gui>System Settings</gui>.
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>
        Open <gui>Universal Access</gui> and select the <gui>Typing</gui> tab.
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>
        Switch <gui>Sticky Keys</gui> on.
      </p>
    </item>
  </steps>

  <note style="tip">
    <title>
      Quickly turn sticky keys on and off
    </title>
    <p>
      Under <gui>Enable by Keyboard</gui>, select <gui>Turn on accessibility 
      features from the keyboard</gui> to turn sticky keys on and off from the 
      keyboard. When this option is selected, you can press <key>Shift</key> 
      five times in a row to enable or disable sticky keys.
    </p>
  </note>

  <p>
    If you press two keys at once, you can have sticky keys turn itself off 
    temporarily to let you enter a keyboard shortcut in the normal way.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, if you have sticky keys turned on but press <key>Alt</key> and 
    <key>Tab</key> simultaneously, sticky keys would not wait for you to press 
    another key if you had this option turned on. It <em>would</em> wait if you 
    only pressed one key, however. This is useful if you are able to press some 
    keyboard shortcuts simultaneously (for example, keys that are close 
    together), but not others.
  </p>

  <p>
    Select <gui>Disable if two keys are pressed together</gui> to enable this.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can have the computer make a "beep" sound when you start typing a 
    keyboard shortcut with sticky keys turned on. This is useful if you want to 
    know that sticky keys is expecting a keyboard shortcut to be typed, so the 
    next key press will be interpreted as part of a shortcut. Select <gui>Beep 
    when a modifier key is pressed</gui> to enable this.
