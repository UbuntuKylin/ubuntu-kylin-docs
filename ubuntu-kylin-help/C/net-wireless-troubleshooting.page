<title>Wireless network troubleshooter</title>

<p>This is a step-by step troubleshooting guide to help you identify and fix wireless problems. If you cannot connect to a wireless network for some reason, try following the instructions here.</p>

<p>We will proceed through the following steps to get your computer connected to the internet:</p>
  <list style="numbered compact">
    <item><p>Performing an initial check</p></item>
    <item><p>Gathering information about your hardware</p></item>
    <item><p>Checking your hardware</p></item>
    <item><p>Attempting to create a connection to your wireless router</p></item>
    <item><p>Performing a check of your modem and router</p></item>
  </list>
  <p>To get started, click on the <em>Next</em> link at the top right of the page. This link, and others like it on following pages, will take you through each step in the guide.</p>

<note>
 <title>Using the command line</title>
 <p>Some of the instructions in this guide ask you to type commands into the <em>command line</em> (Terminal). You can find the Terminal application in the <gui>Dash</gui>.</p>
 <p>If you are not familiar with using a command line, don't worry - this guide will direct you at each step. All you need to remember is that commands are case-sensitive (so you must type them <em>exactly</em> as they appear here), and to press <key>Enter</key> after typing each command to run it.</p>
