<title>Wipe everything off a removable disk</title>

  <p>If you have a removable disk, like a USB memory stick or an external hard
 disk, you may sometimes wish to completely remove all of its files and
 folders. You can do this by <em>formatting</em> the disk - this deletes all
 of the files on the disk and leaves it empty.</p>

<steps>
 <title>Format a removable disk</title>
  <item>
<if:choose>
<if:when test="platform:unity">
   <p>Open the <app>Disks</app> application from the <gui>Dash</gui>.</p>
</if:when>
   <p>Open the <app>Disks</app> application from the <gui>Activities</gui>
   overview.</p>
</if:choose>
  </item>
  <item>
   <p>Select the disk you want to wipe from the <gui>Storage Devices</gui> list.</p>

  <note style="warning">
   <p>Make sure that you have selected the correct disk! If you choose the wrong
 disk, all of the files on the other disk will be deleted!</p>
  </note>
  </item>
  <item>
   <p>In the Volumes section, click <gui>Unmount Volume</gui>. Then click
   <gui>Format Volume</gui>.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
   <p>In the window that pops up, choose a filesystem <gui>Type</gui> for the
   disk.</p>
   <p>If you use the disk on Windows and Mac OS computers in addition to Linux
   computers, choose <gui>FAT</gui>. If you only use it on Windows, <gui>NTFS</gui>
   may be a better option. A brief description of the <gui>file system type</gui>
   will be presented as a label.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
   <p>Give the disk a name and click <gui>Format</gui> to begin wiping the disk.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
   <p>Once the formatting has finished, <gui>safely remove</gui> the disk. It
   should now be blank and ready to use again.</p>
  </item>
</steps>

<note style="warning">
 <title>Formatting a disk does not securely delete your files</title>
  <p>Formatting a disk is not a completely secure way of wiping all of its
 data. A formatted disk will not appear to have files on it, but it is
 possible that special recovery software could retrieve the files. If you
 need to securely delete the files, you will need to use a command-line
 utility, such as <app>shred</app>.</p>
