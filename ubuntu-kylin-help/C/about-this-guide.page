        The guide is divided into small, task-oriented topics - not chapters. 
        This means that you don't need to skim through an entire manual to find 
        answers to your questions.

        The guide is constantly being improved. Although we attempt to provide 
        you with a comprehensive collection of helpful information, we know we 
        won't answer all of your questions here. We will keep adding more 
        information to make things more helpful, though.
