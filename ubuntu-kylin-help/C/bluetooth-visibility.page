  <title>What is Bluetooth visibility?</title>

  <p>Bluetooth visibility simply refers to whether other devices can discover
  your computer when searching for Bluetooth devices. When Bluetooth visibility
  is turned on, your computer will advertise itself to all other devices within
  range, allowing them to attempt to connect to you.</p>

  <p>Your computer does not need to be visible to search for other devices, but
  those devices need to be visible for your computer to discover them.</p>

  <p>After you have <link xref="bluetooth-connect-device">connected to a 
  device</link>, neither your computer nor the device needs to be visible to 
  communicate with each other.</p>

  <p>Unless you or someone you trust needs to connect to your computer from
  another device, you should leave visibility off.</p>
