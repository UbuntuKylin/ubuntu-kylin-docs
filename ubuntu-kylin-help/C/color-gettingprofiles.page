  <title>Where do I get color profiles?</title>

  <p>
    The best way to get profiles is to generate them yourself, although
    this does require some initial outlay.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many manufacturers do try to provide color profiles for devices,
    although sometimes they are wrapped up in <em>driver bundles</em>
    which you may need to download, extract and then search for the
    color profiles.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some manufacturers do not provide accurate profiles for the hardware
    and the profiles are best avoided.
    A good clue is to download the profile, and if the creation date is
    more than a year before the date you bought the device then it's
    likely dummy data generated that is useless.

  <p>
    See <link xref="color-why-calibrate"/> for information on why vendor-supplied
    profiles are often worse than useless.
