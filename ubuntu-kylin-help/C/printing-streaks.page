<title>Why are there streaks, lines or the wrong colors on my print-outs?</title>

  <p>This had a seealso and two inline links to printing-inklevel. I removed
  printing-inklevel for 3.0. If it gets written, add the links back.</p>

  <p>If your print-outs are streaky, faded, have lines on them that shouldn't be
 there, or are otherwise poor in quality, this may be due to a problem with the
 printer or a low ink/toner supply.</p>

 <item>
  <p>Fading text or images</p>
  <p>You may be running out of ink or toner. Check your ink/toner supply and buy
 a new cartridge if necessary.</p>

 <item>
  <p>Streaks and lines</p>
  <p>If you have an inkjet printer, the print head may be dirty or partially
 blocked. Try cleaning the print head (see the printer's manual for
 instructions).</p>
 </item>

 <item>
  <p>Wrong colors</p>
  <p>The printer may have run out of one color of ink or toner. Check your
 ink/toner supply and buy a new cartridge if necessary.</p>
 </item>

 <item>
  <p>Jagged lines, or lines aren't straight</p>
  <p>If lines on your print-out that should be straight turn out jagged, you may
 need to align the print head. See the printer's instruction manual for details
 on how to do this.</p>
