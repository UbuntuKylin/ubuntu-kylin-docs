<title>Add a guest user account</title>

<p>You can create a user account for guests, people who will only use the computer on a brief, temporary basis. The guest user will be able to use the programs on your computer, but they won't be able to access your files, mess with your settings, or install software.</p>

<steps>
  <title>Create a guest user account:</title>

  <item><p>Click your name in the menu bar and select <gui>System Settings</gui>.</p></item>
  <item><p>Click <gui>User Accounts</gui>.</p></item>
  <item><p>Click <gui>Unlock</gui> in the bottom left corner and type your
  password to make changes. You must be an administrative user to add user
  accounts.</p></item>
  <item><p>In the list of accounts on the left, click the <gui>+</gui> button
  to add a new user account.</p></item>
  <item><p>Select <gui>Standard</gui> for the account type. You don't want to
  give the guest account administrative access. Then give the account a name
  like <em>Guest</em>, or any other name you like. The username will be filled
  in automatically based on the full name. The default is probably OK, but you
  can change it if you like. Click <gui>Create</gui> when you're done.</p></item>
  <item><p>The new guest user account will be selected. Under <gui>Login Options</gui>,
  click the button label next to <gui>Password</gui>. You will be presented
  with a window with password options. From the <gui>Action</gui> drop-down
  list, select <gui>Log in without a password</gui>.</p></item>
</steps>

<p>If you like, you can click the image next to the guest user's name on
the right to set an image for the account. This image will be shown in
the login window. GNOME provides some stock photos you can use, or you
can select your own or take a picture with your webcam.</p>
