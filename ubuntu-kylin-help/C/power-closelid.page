    <desc>Laptops go to sleep when you close the lid, in order to save power.</desc>
  </info>

<title>Why does my computer turn off when I close the lid?</title>

<p>When you close the lid of your laptop, your computer will <link
xref="power-suspend"><em>suspend</em></link> in order to save power. This means
that the computer isn't actually turned off - it has just gone to sleep. You
can resume it by opening the lid. If it doesn't resume, try clicking the mouse
or pressing a key. If that still doesn't work, press the power button.</p>

<p>Some computers are unable to suspend properly, normally because their
hardware isn't completely supported by the operating system (for example, the
Linux drivers are incomplete). In this case, you may find that you are unable
to resume your computer after you've closed the lid. You can try to <link
xref="power-suspendfail">fix the problem with suspend</link>, or you can
prevent the computer from trying to suspend when you close the lid.</p>

 <title>Stop the computer from suspending when the lid is closed</title>
 <p>If you don't want the computer to suspend when you close the lid, you can change the settings for that behavior:</p>
 <note style="warning">
   <p>Be very careful if you change this setting. Some laptops can overheat
   if they are left running with the lid closed, especially if they are in
   a confined place like a backpack.</p>
