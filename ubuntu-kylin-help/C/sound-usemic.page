  <title>Use a different microphone</title>

  <p>You can use an external microphone for chatting with friends, speaking
  with colleagues at work, making voice recordings, or using other multimedia
  applications. Even if your computer has a built-in microphone or a webcam
  with a microphone, a separate microphone usually provides better audio
  quality.</p>

  <p>If your microphone has a circular plug, just plug it into the appropriate
  adapter on your computer. Most computers have two adapters: one for
  microphones and one for speakers. Look for a picture of a microphone next to
  the adapter. Microphones plugged into the appropriate adapter will usually
  be used by default. If not, see the instructions below for selecting a
  default input device.</p>

  <p>If you have a USB microphone, plug it into any USB port on your
  computer. USB microphones act as separate audio devices, and you may
  have to specify which microphone to use by default.</p>

    <item><p>On the <gui>Input</gui> tab, select the device in the list of devices.
    The input level indicator should respond when you speak.</p></item>
