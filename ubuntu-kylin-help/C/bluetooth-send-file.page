    <p>You can send files to connected Bluetooth devices, such as some mobile
    phones or other computers. Some types of devices don't allow the transfer
    of files, or specific types of files. You can send files in one of three
    ways: using the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar, from the Bluetooth settings
    window, or directly from the file manager.</p>

    <title>Send files using the Bluetooth icon</title>
    <item>
      <if:choose>
        <if:when test="platform:unity">
      <p>Click the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar and select <gui>Send Files to 
      Device</gui>.</p>
        </if:when>
      <p>Click the Bluetooth icon on the top bar and select <gui>Send Files to 
      Device</gui>.</p>
      </if:choose>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Choose the file you want to send and click <gui>Select</gui>.</p>
      <p>To send more than one file in a folder, hold down <key>Ctrl</key> as 
      you select each file.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Select the device which you want to send the files to and click 
      <gui>Send</gui>.</p>
      <p>The list of devices will show both <link 
      xref="bluetooth-connect-device">devices you are already connected 
      to</link> as well as <link xref="bluetooth-visibility">visible 
      devices</link> within range. If you have not already connected to the 
      selected device, you will be prompted to pair with the device after 
      clicking <gui>Send</gui>. This will probably require confirmation on the 
      other device.</p>
      <p>If there are many devices, you can limit the list to only specific 
      device types using the <gui>Device type</gui> drop-down.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>The owner of the receiving device usually has to press a button to 
      accept the file. Once the owner accepts or declines, the result of the 
      file transfer will be shown on your screen.</p>
